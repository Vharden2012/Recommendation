### 3. Dell Inspiron 3420

I suggest the [Dell Inspiron 3420](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dell-inspiron-3420-14-touch-laptop-snapdragon-8cx-gen-2-8gb-memory-256gb-solid-state-drive-platinum-silver/6525656.p?skuId=6525656&ref=212&loc=1&ref=212&loc=1&gclid=7f1b7c53dd381643e9ab18e57c91ae7a&gclsrc=3p.ds&msclkid=7f1b7c53dd381643e9ab18e57c91ae7a).

## Our Recommendation

After carefully considering all three options, the **Dell Inspiron 3420** emerges as the best choice. Here's why:

1. **Performance**: The Dell Inspiron 3420 runs on a Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 processor and has 8GB of memory. This makes it suitable for heavier tasks that our team might encounter, surpassing the performance of the Lenovo Ideapad 1 and the Lenovo IdeaPad 3i.

2. **Touchscreen Functionality**: The inclusion of a touchscreen adds a level of interactivity that's not available in the other two options. This feature could improve productivity and user experience, especially for creative tasks or presentations.

3. **Storage**: With a 256GB SSD, the Inspiron 3420 provides sufficient storage for most of our needs. While it's less than the IdeaPad 3i's 512GB SSD, it's twice as much as the Ideapad 1's 128GB SSD.

Despite its higher price, the Dell Inspiron 3420's superior performance, touchscreen, and decent storage make it the most suitable laptop for our organization.
